	Abstract = {To address the coding and software challenges of modern hybrid architectures, we propose a modern approach to multiphysics code development. The approach is based on using a Domain Specific Language in tandem with runtime algorithm generation. When coupled with a large-scale parallel framework, the result is an architecture-proof code capable of executing on hybrid platforms. We share our experience developing such a code - an effort that spans an interdisciplinary team of engineers and computer scientists.},

	Abstract = {In this study, a comprehensive methodology is developed for computing the radiative emission of a generalized enclosure containing an absorbing, emitting, scattering medium. The principle of reciprocity in radiative transfer provides the basis for a reverse Monte Carlo solution for the emission. The result is an approach founded upon complete paths through the enclosure. These paths constitute a generalization of the line-of-sight concept to include the effects of scattering and boundary reflection. Line-of-sight based models for gas absorption can then be incorporated without approximation. Sample results for the emission from a nonhomogeneous, nonisothermal cylindrical medium containing gray particles and a real gas are included. },
